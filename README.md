Materials for [Sept 24 blogdown workshop](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/264595913/) for R-Ladies Chicago

This workshop is more of a web development in R workshop than a data science in R workshop - you'll find that there are only a few functions in blogdown that we use, and the rest is about file organization, and putting things in the right place to make a properly formatted website with blogdown. If you've come here for data analysis, I'll warn you that you've come to the wrong place!
